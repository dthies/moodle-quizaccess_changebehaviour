quizaccess_changebehaviour
=================

This is a quiz access rule for Moodle Quiz that adds settings to the
quiz to override the question behaviour with new value after a specified
time. It can be used to penalize students that procrastinate by changing
to a less favorable behaviour.

Copy this directory to quiz/accessrule/changebehaviour in Moodle
directory. Login as admin to complete plugin installation.  Then specify
time and new behaviour while editng quiz settings. The new behaviour
will apply to all attempts started after the specified time.
