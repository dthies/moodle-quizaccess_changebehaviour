quizaccess_changebehaviour
=================

This is a quiz access rule for Moodle Quiz that adds settings to the
quiz to extend the close time and override the question behaviour with
new value during the extension. It can be used to penalize students that
procrastinate by changing to a less favorable behaviour.

Copy this directory to quiz/accessrule/changebehaviour in Moodle
directory. Login as admin to complete plugin installation.  Then specify
time and new behaviour while editng quiz settings. The new behaviour
will apply to all attempts started after the specified time.
